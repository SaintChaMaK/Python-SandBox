#        Conditions and conditional execution:
#        Conditions enables to have a  mechanism which will allow you to do something if a condition is met, 
#            and not do it if it isn't.
#        
#        To make such decisions, Python offers a special instruction. Due to its nature and its application,
#             it's called a conditional instruction (or conditional statement).
#                For example:
#                        if true_or_not:
#                            do_this_if_true
#
#        01. Conditional execution (if.. statement)
#            This conditional statement consists of the following, strictly necessary,
#                 elements in this and this order only:
#
#                        01. the if keyword;
#                        02. one or more white spaces;
#                        03. an expression (a question or an answer) whose value will be
#                                             interpreted solely in terms of True (when its value is non-zero)
#                                                                         and False (when it is equal to zero);
#                        04. a colon followed by a newline;
#                        05. an indented instruction or set of instructions (at least one instruction is absolutely required);
#                                     the indentation may be achieved in two ways
#                                         by inserting a particular number of spaces 
#                                         (the recommendation is to use four spaces of indentation),
#                                           or by using the tab character; note: if there is more than one instruction in the indented part,
#                                             the indentation should be the same in all lines; even though it may look the same if you use tabs mixed with spaces,
#                                               it's important to make all indentations exactly the same – Python 3 does not allow the mixing of spaces and tabs for indentation.
#                        
#                        How does that statement work?
#
#                        01. If the true_or_not expression represents the truth (i.e., its value is not equal to zero),
#                                the indented statement(s) will be executed;
#                        02. if the true_or_not expression does not represent the truth (i.e., its value is equal to zero),
#                                the indented statement(s) will be omitted (ignored), and the next executed instruction
#                                     will be the one after the original indentation level.
#                                     For example:
#                                        if sheep_counter >= 120: # Evaluate a test expression
#                                            sleep_and_dream() # Execute if test expression is True
#
#                        ***- conditionally executed statements have to be indented.
#                        if sheep_counter >= 120:
#                            make_a_bed()
#                            take_a_shower()
#                            sleep_and_dream()
#                        feed_the_sheepdogs()
#
#                        As you can see, making a bed, taking a shower and falling asleep and dreaming
#                          are all executed conditionally – when sheep_counter reaches the desired limit.
#
#                        Feeding the sheepdogs, however, is always done (i.e., the feed_the_sheepdogs() function
#                             is not indented and does not belong to the if block, which means it is always executed.)
#
#
#        02. Conditional execution: (if-else statement)
#            For example:
#                if true_or_false_condition:
#                    perform_if_condition_true
#                else:
#                perform_if_condition_false
#
#
#            -another example:
#                if the_weather_is_good:
#                    go_for_a_walk()
#                else:
#                    go_to_a_theater()
#                have_lunch()
#
#
#
#            -another example:
#            if the_weather_is_good:
#                go_for_a_walk()
#            have_fun()
#            else:
#                go_to_a_theater()
#                enjoy_the_movie()
#            have_lunch()
#
#
#            ##- Nested if-else statements
#            For example:
#            if the_weather_is_good:
#                if nice_restaurant_is_found:
#                    have_lunch()
#                else:
#                    eat_a_sandwich()
#            else:
#                if tickets_are_available:
#                     go_to_the_theater()
#                else:
#                    go_shopping()
#
#
#        Here are two important points:
#
#        01. this use of the if statement is known as nesting;
#          remember that every else refers to the if which lies at the same indentation level;
#            you need to know this to determine how the ifs and elses pair up;
#                consider how the indentation improves readability,
#                     and makes the code easier to understand and trace.
#
#    03. Conditional execution ( elif statement )
#            elif is used to check more than just one condition,
#                 and to stop when the first statement which is true is found.
#                    For example:
#                        if the_weather_is_good:
#                            go_for_a_walk()
#                        elif tickets_are_available:
#                            go_to_the_theater()
#                        elif table_is_available:
#                            go_for_lunch()
#                        else:
#                            play_chess_at_home()
#
#                The way to assemble subsequent if-elif-else statements is sometimes called a cascade.
#                        Some additional attention has to be paid in this case:
#
#                        - you mustn't use else without a preceding if;
#                        - else is always the last branch of the cascade, regardless of whether you've used elif or not;
#                        - else is an optional part of the cascade, and may be omitted;
#                        - if there is an else branch in the cascade, only one of all the branches is executed;
#                        - if there is no else branch, it's possible that none of the available branches is executed.

#Scenario
#Once upon a time there was a land – a land of milk and honey, inhabited by happy and prosperous people. The people paid taxes, of course – their happiness had limits. The most important tax, called the Personal Income Tax (PIT for short) had to be paid once a year, and was evaluated using the following rule:
#
#if the citizen's income was not higher than 85,528 thalers, the tax was equal to 18% of the income minus 556 thalers and 2 cents (this was what they called tax relief)
#if the income was higher than this amount, the tax was equal to 14,839 thalers and 2 cents, plus 32% of the surplus over 85,528 thalers.
#Your task is to write a tax calculator.
#
#It should accept one floating-point value: the income.
#Next, it should print the calculated tax, rounded to full thalers. There's a function named round() which will do the rounding for you.
#Note: this happy country never returned any money to its citizens. If the calculated tax was less than zero, it would only mean no tax at all (the tax was equal to zero). Take this into consideration during your calculations.
#
#Look at the code in the editor – it only reads one input value and outputs a result, so you need to complete it with some smart calculations.
