""" 
Variables are containers for a storing data value, 
            it can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
"""

"""
         Do not need to be declared by any particular type, since type can be changed even after setting it.
         
    01. The name of the variable must be composed of upper-case or lower-case letters, digits, and the character _ (underscore)
            They can't have spaces (E.x, test var is not allowed)
                                    (E.x, test_var! is not allowed)
    02. The name of the variable must begin with a letter
    03. The underscore character is a letter
                    _vart = 23
                    tyyt = 21
                    print(_vart)
                    print(tyyt)
    04. Variables are Case-sensitive which means,
                upper- and lower-case letters are treated as different
                      (a little differently than in the real world where Saint and SAINT are the same first names,
                        but in Python they are two different variable names, and consequently, two different variables)

    05. The name of the variable must not be any of Python's reserved keywords or predefined.
                ['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 
                'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if',
                  'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 
                  'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']
Then, to create the variable, you need to use = to assign the value that you want it to have.

You can always take a look at the value assigned to the variable by using print() and putting the name of the variable in parentheses.

#Summary
"""
        A variable is a named location reserved to store values in the memory.
                     A variable is created or initialized automatically when you assign a value to it for the first time.
                                            E.x  a = 1
                                                 b = "Saint"
                                                 c = 1.2

        Variable must have a unique name or an identifier.
                     A legal identifier name must be a non-empty sequence of characters,
                      can with the underscore(_), or a letter, and it cannot be a Python keyword. 
                      The first character may be followed by underscores, letters, and digits.
                       Identifiers in Python are case-sensitive.

        Python is a dynamically-typed language,
                     which means you don't need to declare variables in it.
                     To assign values to variables, you can use a simple assignment operator in the form of the equal (=) sign.

        03. compound assignment operators (shortcut operators) can be used to modify/ format values assigned to variables,
                     for example: var += 1,
                                  var /= 5 * 2.

        04. You can assign new values to already existing variables using the assignment operator or one of the compound operators,
         for example:
            var = 2
            print(var)

            var = 3
            print(var)

            var += 1
            print(var)


"""


a = 6
b = 3
a /= 2 * b # a = a / 2 * b
#print(a)
"""
the answer is 1.0, atleast for what i know is because
     of the fact that The result produced by the division operator is always a float
