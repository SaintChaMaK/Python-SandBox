"""
Docstring for The-First-Python-Program.FirstPythonScript

To print text to the screen in Python, you use the print() function. A
function is a bit of code that typically takes some input, called an argument, does something with that input, and produces some output,
called the return value.

"""

print("Hello, World")


"""
Here "Hello, world" is the argument that is being passed to print().
"Hello, world" must be written with quotation marks so that Python
interprets it as text and not something else.

"""

"""
An interactive window [Interactive Development and Learning Environment](IDLE) can execute only a single line of code at a time.
This is useful for trying out small code examples and exploring the
Python language, but it has a major limitation. Code must be entered
in by a person one line at a time!
Alternatively, you can store some Python code in a text file and then
execute all of the code in the file with a single command. The code in
the file is called a script, and files containing Python scripts are called
script рles.
Script files are nice not only because they make it easier to run a program, but also because they can be shared with other people so that
they can run your program, too
