"""
Docstring for The-First-Python-Program.FirstPythonScript

To print text to the screen in Python, you use the print() function. A
function is a bit of code that typically takes some input, called an argument, does something with that input, and produces some output,
called the return value.

"""

print("Hello, World")


"""
Here "Hello, world" is the argument that is being passed to print().
"Hello, world" must be written with quotation marks so that Python
interprets it as text and not something else.
