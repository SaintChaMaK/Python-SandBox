#COMMENTS
"""
        A comment:
            is aremark inserted into a program which is omitted at a runtime.
        - it begins with a hash(#) sign

         Although it must be stated that the best way of commenting variables 
         is to name them in an unambiguous manner.
         For example area_of_squre
                        has a bit of meaning than using area_joe to initiate a variable
                            That is good for self commmenting.

Programmers often read code they wrote several months ago and wonder “What the heck does this do?” Even with descriptive variable
names, it can be difficult to remember why you wrote something the
way you did when you haven’t looked at it for a long time.
To help avoid this problem, you can leave comments in your code.
Comments are lines of text that don’t affect the way the script runs.
They help to document what’s supposed to be happening.

### Single comment are written as this 
# -- this is a single comment





#Multiline comment
#this is 
#a multline
#comment





#Since python ignorea strings which are not assigned to variable you can use triple quotes to assign multiline comment

"""
        01. Comments can be used to leave additional information in code.
                 They are omitted at runtime.
                     The information left in the source code is addressed to human readers.
                       In Python, a comment is a piece of text that begins with #.
                         The comment extends to the end of the line.

        02. If you want to place a comment that spans several lines,
                         you need to place # in front of them all. 
                                    Moreover, you can use a comment to mark a piece of code that is not needed at the moment.
                                      for example:

                                        # This program prints
                                        # an introduction to the screen.
                                        print("Hello!")  # Invoking the print() function
                                        # print("I'm Python.")
                                        
        03. self-commenting names to variables is the best practice.
                            for example:
                                  if you're using two variables to store the length and width of something, 
                                  the variable names length and width may be a better choice
                                                                         than myvar1 and myvar2.

        04. It's important to use comments to make programs easier to understand,
                 and to use readable and meaningful variable names in code.
                     However, it's equally important not to use variable names that are confusing,
                             or leave comments that contain wrong or incorrect information!

        05. Comments can be important when you are reading your own code after some time.
                (trust us, developers do forget what their own code does),
                    and when others are reading your code (they can help them understand 
                                                        what your programs do and how they do it more quickly).
